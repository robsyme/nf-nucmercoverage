# nf-nucmercoverage

## Introduction

This is a humble nextflow pipeline to compare the coverage of some
reference genome(s) by nucmer matches of some other genomes. It takes
gziped fasta files as input, runs nucmer, and plots the location of
the matches (both repetitive and unique) on the reference genome.
